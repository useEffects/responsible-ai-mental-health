\section{Case Studies and Examples}
\subsection{Caryn AI}
CarynAI \cite{lorenz2023influencers}, a chatbot designed to replicate the personality and interactions of its creator, Caryn Marjorie. Caryn Marjorie wanted to talk to as many of her followers as she could â€” so she made an AI clone of herself. The developers dedicated over 2,000 hours to meticulously design and code Caryn's language and personality into an immersive Al experience. Using her unique voice, captivating persona, and distinctive behavior, Caryn Al brings a dynamic, one-of-a-kind interaction that feels like you're talking directly to Caryn herself. One safeguard is trying to limit the amount of time a user is allowed to chat with CarynAI. To keep users from becoming addicted, CarynAI is programmed to wind down conversations after about an hour, encouraging users to pick back up later. But there is no hard time limit on use, and some users are spending hours speaking to CarynAI per day, according to Marjorie's manager, Ishan Goel. However, access to this version of CarynAI was interrupted when the chief executive of Forever Voices was arrested for attempted arson.
