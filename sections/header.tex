\begin{abstract}
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming deeply integrated into daily life, profoundly transforming communication and interactions. Over 50\% of Internet traffic is generated by machine-to-machine communication, with person-to-machine interactions also increasing. Chatbots, softbots, and virtual assistants are becoming essential in everyday life \cite{elliott2019culture}. Recent advances in generative AI, such as ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion, are approaching human-level capabilities.
