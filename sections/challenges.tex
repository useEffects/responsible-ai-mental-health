\section{Challenges}
To fully achieve the potential of AI in healthcare, four major ethical issues must be addressed: (1) informed consent to use data, (2) safety and transparency, (3) algorithmic fairness and biases, and (4) data privacy \cite{gerke2020ethical}. Using LLM in AI Companion app brings the challenges faced by LLMs into the focus as well \cite{sarker2024llm}. While hardening LLMs for safety can help, models remain vulnerable to adversarial inputs, as demonstrated by the spread of "jailbreaks" for ChatGPT since its initial release \cite{andriushchenko2024jailbreaking}. Another jailbreak approach known as mosaic prompting \cite{glukhov2023llm}, demonstrates that semantic censorship can be perceived as an undecidable problem, highlighting the inherent challenges in censorship that arise due to LLMs' programmatic and instruction-following capabilities. Furthermore, we argue that the challenges extend beyond semantic censorship, as knowledgeable attackers can reconstruct impermissible outputs from a collection of permissible ones.
